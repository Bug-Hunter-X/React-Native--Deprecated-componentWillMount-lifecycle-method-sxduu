This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug involving the use of the deprecated `componentWillMount` lifecycle method. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The solution, shown in `bugSolution.js`, uses the recommended `componentDidMount` method or a functional component with `useEffect` hook to achieve the same functionality.
